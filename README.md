# surfs_up

## Overview
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

The purpose of this analysis is to perform an analysis on weather data that has been stored in a SQLite database, and present results to the investor before project is approved for new Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii.  Specifically the investor is hesitant due to previously failed locations due to weather conditions, thus he has requested an indept analysis of this specific locations weather.

## Challenge Deliverables
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results 
In comparing June and December there is only a slight variation in temperature overall, and heavy continuous rainfall was low.  Specifically in June precipation is on average 14%, while in December it is only slightly higher at 22%.  One can also look at temperatures.  June showed an average temp of 74.94 degrees, while December's average temperature was at 71.04 degrees.  That is only approximately 3 degrees difference in temperature.

## Summary 
Overall the weather data analysis provided to the investor shows that his funding of this project would not be affected by adverse weather.  There is little variation in the average temperature from summer and winter months, as well as low risk of heavy/continuous rainfall that might affect customer visits/sales.  

I performed two additinal queries to show a side by side easily viewable comparison of temperatures and precipitation in both June and December.  The months in question of most concern by the client.
